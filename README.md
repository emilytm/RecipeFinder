# RecipeFinder

RecipeFinder is a personal recipe management tool that I created as the solo project for the 'Responsive Design' module of the Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path. While the prompt was for a learning journal or a hike finder, I built a recipe management tool because it was something I thought I'd use and be more likely to keep working on. This was the first project that I used CSS Grid.

**Next steps:** Connect search experience to recipe search API used in CookList project, store saved recipes in a more robust way, add more fields and make most or all fields editable, add concept of users with log in/sign up, refactor as React app, etc.
